## My process

My process was to first open up the desktop preview images Frontend Mentor provides for the challenge in a basic image editing program. I just used Microsoft Paint. Then I took the selection tool and dragged boxes over different elements so I could take measurements so I could get the page to be as close as possible to a 1:1 copy. I then opened up the folder into my IDE and went to work reading the readme file and coding in all of the html and css necessary.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

It's been a little while since I've used standard CSS, so it was a nice refresher on how to use it.

### Continued development

I'd like to continue building skills in CSS and all areas of Web Development. There is so much to learn and it's great to have a place like Frontend Mentor to help with that.
